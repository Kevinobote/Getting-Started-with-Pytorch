# PyTorch Project README

This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment to work with PyTorch.

## Requirements

1. **Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). PyTorch requires Python 3.x, so make sure to install the latest version of Python 3.

2. **pip**: pip is the package installer for Python. It usually comes pre-installed with Python. You can verify if it's installed by running:

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

   If pip is not installed, follow the installation instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

3. **PyTorch**: PyTorch can be installed via pip. Use the following command to install PyTorch:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

   This command installs PyTorch along with torchvision and torchaudio, which are commonly used packages for computer vision and audio tasks. If you want to install the CPU-only version (no GPU support), you can use the `cpuonly` tag:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly
   ```

   For more installation options, refer to the [official PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

4. **Optional Packages**: Depending on your project requirements, you may need additional packages. Some commonly used packages include:

   - NumPy: For numerical computations.
   - Matplotlib: For data visualization.
   - Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and experimentation.

   You can install these packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

## Verification

After completing the installation steps, you can verify that PyTorch is installed correctly by opening a Python interpreter and importing PyTorch:

```python
import torch
```

If there are no errors, PyTorch has been successfully installed.

## Learning Resources

Now that you have set up the environment, you can start learning PyTorch. Here are some recommended resources to get started:

- [Official PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/): A collection of tutorials covering various topics from basic tensor operations to building and training neural networks.
- Online courses: Platforms like Coursera, Udacity, and Udemy offer courses on PyTorch and deep learning.
- Books: There are several books available on PyTorch and deep learning, such as "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann.
